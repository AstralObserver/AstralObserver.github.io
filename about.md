## Who I Am

Howdy, I'm Melody! I'm a programmer by trade, a data analyst by hobby, and an optimizer at heart. I love the process of breaking down a problem and finding the solution one puzzle piece at a time. A very important part of my life is being transgender, and it fuels my passion for advocacy and community service. I am dedicated to supporting and uplifting others, both in the tech world and beyond.

## On Programming

I've loved to code ever since I first started towards the end of high school. Being able to build my own tools from scratch whenever I run into a new problem is not only very satisfying but also helps me get a broader understanding of the problem that I might not've had otherwise. It's one thing for me to run my head into a problem again and again until it's done, but another thing entirely to break it down and understand it enough to create a program to help me with it. I'm most in my element in the backend, skimming data and creating processes. Whether they be standalone or just a segment of a larger system, I adore every bit of the programming process. Working with databases is another passion of mine. I enjoy finding new ways to streamline data collection and storage or coming up with a new perspective through which to analyze existing data.

## Creative Endeavors

When I'm not enthralled by code and data, I love to read and write. I've had a special fascination with fantasy and sci-fi for as long as I can remember and have always absolutely devoured books that find their way into my hands. I'm infatuated with all sorts of aesthetics from steampunk to solarpunk and everything between and beyond. I love the freedom that writing gives me to explore new worlds and take a look at real-world problems through a magically tinted lens. I've found myself at the table of many a tabletop group as both a player and a gamemaster.
