## A Space for My Projects

As a bit of a scatterbrained person jumping from topic to topic, this will be a place to keep updated on all of my projects as I jump between them. Any large improvements to any of my projects will be logged here to keep me focused.

## A Space for My Writing

I don't only make code. My love of creating new things sometimes dips into fictional writing and worldbuilding. I might ocassionally create a post or two about my latest scraps of writing or larger concepts for my fictional settings.

## Stay Tuned

This is the space where I'll set up a connection to an email subscription for those that want direct updates when I release anything big!
